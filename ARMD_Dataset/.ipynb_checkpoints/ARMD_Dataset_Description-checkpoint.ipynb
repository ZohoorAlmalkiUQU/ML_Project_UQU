    "# Antibiotic Resistance Microbiology Dataset (ARMD): A de-identified resource for studying antimicrobial resistance using electronic health records\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a pressing global health challenge, exacerbated by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Efforts to mitigate AMR require high-quality datasets to analyze trends in microbial susceptibility, guide clinical decision-making, and inform stewardship programs. electronic health records (EHR) are a rich source of real-world data that can be leveraged to study antimicrobial use and resistance patterns. However, constructing meaningful datasets from EHR data requires rigorous curation and preprocessing to ensure accuracy, relevance, and usability. ARMD aims to facilitate research in antimicrobial stewardship, with applications in identifying resistance patterns, evaluating treatment practices, and informing public health interventions. By leveraging de-identified EHR data from Stanford Healthcare, this dataset provides a unique opportunity to generate insights that can help improve infectious disease management and curb the spread of AMR. The dataset includes detailed information on culture positivity, organism identification, and antibiotic susceptibility across 55 antibiotics. By supporting the development of algorithms for predicting susceptibility and selecting effective treatments, ARMD offers researchers the tools to optimize empiric antibiotic therapy while minimizing the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, ARMD enables the exploration of broader questions in causal inference and policy learning by leveraging antibiotic susceptibility testing as a proxy for counterfactual outcomes under different treatments. With its large cohort of over 283,000 adult patients and a diverse set of microbiological cultures, this dataset supports a range of research applications, from evaluating resistance patterns to improving clinical guidelines for antimicrobial stewardship.\n",
